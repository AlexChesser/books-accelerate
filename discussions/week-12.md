# Week 12: Chapter 27 & 28 & 29 Services: Great and Small, The Test Boundary, Clean Embedded Architecture


## Services: Great and Small

- services may seem to be strongly decoupled from each other
- services appear to support independence of development and deployment 
- these are both only partially true

### Service Architecture

- some services are no more than expensive function calls
- as such they are not necessarily architecturally significant

### Service Benefits: the fallacies

- decoupling fallacy: services can often be coupled according to the data they share
- fallacy of independent development and deployment:
