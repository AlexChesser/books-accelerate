# Week 3 - Design Principles  S.O.L.I.D

## A warning

- The chapters on SOLID principles do not dwell on explaining what SOLID principles ARE. If you have not yet learned them or want a refresher, take a moment to go through some content on them before proceeding (or cross your fingers :) that's OK too)
- The chapters ahead will focus on the SOLID principles implications for architecture
- some "refresher content"
  - a "children's book" on SOLID : https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/the-s-o-l-i-d-principles-in-pictures-b34ce2f1e898 
  - Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID
  - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHiWqnTWsn4> from the author himself (80 minutes)
  - my personal favorite explanations are from Jason Weimann @ Unity3d.college they're very specific to writing games in Unity, but they're designed in a way which really makes the content "concrete" in a real way with a fun visual example. Plus, he has good production value.
