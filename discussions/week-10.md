# Week 10: Chapter 22 & 23 The Clean Architecture, Presenters and Humble Objects

## 22 The Clean Architecture

- Interestingly the book takes a moment to name a few other "types" of architecture while noting their similarities
  - Hexagonal architecture - aka ports and adapters [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/growing-object-oriented-software/9780321574442/)
  - DCI - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction>, <https://dzone.com/articles/dci-architecture-is-visionary>
  - BCE - <https://www.ivarjacobson.com/publications/books/object-oriented-software-engineering-1992>
- each architecture has the following common themes (each theme has been discussed in an earlier chapter)
  - independent of frameworks
  - testable
  - independent of the UI
  - independent fo the database
  - independent of any external agency - specifically business rules
