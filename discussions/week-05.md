## Chapter 12 - Components

- this chapter is mainly a history lesson on the reasons why components exist it gives good perspective on the why and how this design emerged and makes sense
- Components are the units of deployment in a system 
- The smallest entities that can be individually deployed
  - DLLs, jar files, gem files, an NPM MODULE are all _components_
- Components are independently DEPLOYABLE
- Components are independently DEVELOPABLE

### A Brief History of Components

- Programmers used to control the memeory location of their code. 
- Programs would quite literally specify the exact memory address their function would live at (wild)
- If a programmer wanted to work with an existing "LIBRARY" they would have to write their code such that it did not conflict with the memory locations of the library they were consuming
