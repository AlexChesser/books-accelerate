# LGTM shipit presents BOOKS!  

So it turns out that there are a few more computer technology books I'd like to read over the coming year. And of course, if you're not taking extensive notes, are you even reading it?!

Join me in reading some of the new modern classics of technology books where I read and summarize what I'm learning.

Hopefully, you get something of value out of this.

## The Books

- [**Clean Architecture**](./clean-architecture/), In this series of 13 lessons I run through the contents of the book a few chapters at a time.

We talk about "SOLID principles" of design and the separation of concerns. From the first lines of code you write to fully-baked systems. I learned a few new things and had a fair number of my existing assumptions confirmed.

This was the first book series delivered. Future series will focus on the books alone and will not feature discussions with live-stream visitors.

- [**Accelerate**](./accelerate/) This book by Dr. Nicole Forgren, Jez Humble and, Gene Kim is based on rigorous scientific research into the state of dev ops. Through surveys of tens of thousands of engineering organizations, the authors attempt to answer questions about what makes engineering organizations successful.

Exciting stuff!

- [**Designing Distributed Systems**](./designing-distributed-systems) Brendan Burns was one of the co-founders of the Kubernetes project. In this book, he attempts to do for "distributed systems patterns" what the gang of four did for object-oriented design patterns.

- [**Designing Data-Intensive Applications**](./designing-data-intensive-applications) (coming soon!)
