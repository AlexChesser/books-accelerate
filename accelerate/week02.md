# Week 02 - Chapter 01 - Accelerate

- Unless our IT organizations work within a constant state of inprovement, we will fall behind our competitors

### broad findings

- High performaing organizations will accelerate:
  - delivery of goods and services
  - engagement with the market 
  - anticipate reulatory and compliance issues
  - response to security risks / economic changes

- Software and tech are key differentiators for orgs in the delivery of value to customers and stakeholders
- strategic use of technology explains revenue and producitvity gains MORE than mergers, acquisitions and entrepreneurship
- link has been foud between use of technology and profitablity

- devops has emerged as a key factor in differentiating orgs
  - the answer to how do we build secure resiliant rapidly evolving sistributed systems at scale
- the following are now considered necessary:
  - continuous integration
  - continuous delivery
  - lean practices
  - collaborative culture

- devops is accelerating technology HOWEVER organizations often over-estimate their progress when compared to competitiors
- the potential for value delivery within organizations is often MUCH greater than executive teams realize

## Focus on Capablilities, not Maturity

- maturity models are flawed versus capability models

### four factors 

1. maturity models are about "arriving at a final state" while capbablity is focussed on continuing improvement
2. maturity models prescribe a one size fits all or central process while capbablity models allow autonomous teams
3. maturity models tend to measure vanity metrics without tying them to outcomes (eg:  install base of a certain tool) capablity models focus on key outcomes
4. maturity models focus on a static level of technological progress while capablity models aim to remain competitive

## Evidence based transformations focus on key capablities

- transformation is available to anyone, the following has been found to not predict performance
  -  **age of technology** 
  -  **ops teams** vs. **dev teams** being responsible for deployments
  -  a **change approval board** (note this is later listed as negatively correlated with performance in a later chapter)
-  last week's **24 key capablities** have been foud to predict performance

## the value of adopting devops

- the study's findings have foud DevOps to be more impactful than originally thought

- 46 times more frequent deployments
- 440 times faster from commit to deploy
- 170 times faster mean time to recovery
- 5 times lower change failure rate
