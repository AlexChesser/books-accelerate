# Week 01: Accelerate - Building and scaling high performing technology organizations

## foreword

> We can now assert with confidence that high IT performance correlates with strong business performance, helping to boost productivity, profitability, and market share.

That's it. This is the point of the book. **Accelerate** at its core is about making and proving the bold claim that IT systems are a key driver for business success in our digital world.

- highly effective organizations take about an hour to get code from "committed into main" to "running in production"  
- they can update their code many times a day  
- this does not cost them stability, in fact, it comes BECAUSE of stability  
- updates fail at a fraction of the rate they happen in typical organizations  
- failures are usually fixed within an hour  
- we refute the notion that we have SPEED or STABILITY  
- speed REQUIRES stability  
- Strong engineering practice gives you both.  

- it is time to focus on digital as the growth engine for business  
- old model optimizes for IT cost  
- new model optimizes for SPEED

## CAPABILITIES TO DRIVE IMPROVEMENT

(This will probably be on the test) the research has found five broad categories and 24 capabilities that drive improvement.

### The Categories

- Continuous delivery
- Architecture
- Product and process
- Lean management and monitoring
- Cultural

#### CONTINUOUS DELIVERY CAPABILITIES

- Version control
- Deployment automation
- Continuous integration
- Trunk-based development
- Test automation
- Test data management
- Shift left on security
- Continuous delivery (CD)

#### ARCHITECTURE CAPABILITIES

- Loosely coupled architecture
- Empowered teams

#### PRODUCT AND PROCESS CAPABILITIES

- Customer feedback
- Value stream
- Working in small batches
- Team experimentation

#### LEAN MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES

- Change approval processes
- Monitoring
- Proactive notification
- WIP limits
- Visualizing work

#### CULTURAL CAPABILITIES

- Westrum organizational culture
- Supporting learning
- Collaboration among teams
- Job satisfaction
- Transformational leadership

## Preface

- this research shows that companies who can accelerate their delivery of software can drive results that increase their profitability, productivity, and market share.
- this in turn, drives strong effects in effectiveness, efficiency, and customer satisfaction
- these results are statistically significant
- they come from cross-sectional studies

### the research

- software development is an exercise in continuous improvement  
- research shows that the best keep getting better  
- the worst fall further behind  

> ### Improvement is possible for everyone
>
> (_As long as leadership provides consistent support, including time, actions, and resources_)

- Studies discussed in the book were conducted from 2014 to 2017  
    - 2014  
        - what does it mean to deliver software, can it be measured?  
        - does software delivery impact organizations?  
        - does culture matter? can we measure it?  
        - what technical practices matter?  
    - 2015  
        - does automation matter?  
        - does "lean management" matter?
        - how does process and management affect things like burnout?  
    - 2016  
        - Does security help or slow down process?  
        - does "trunk based development" improve delivery? (I assume this is defined later!)
        - does strong technical practice encourage loyalty?  
    - 2017  
        - what architectural practice drives software performance?  
        - how does "transformational leadership" affect delivery?  
        - does this hold true in the non profit sector?
