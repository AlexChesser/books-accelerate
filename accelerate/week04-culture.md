# Measuring and Changing Culture

- it is possible to change company culture by implementing devops practices
- organizational culture can exist at three levels
  - basic assumptions: things we "just know", possibly difficult to articulate
  - values: visible to group members possibly debated and discussed
  - artifacts: mission statements, creeds, formal procedures (inspiration posters)

## Westrum organizational archetypes

- **Pathological**: (power oriented)
  - characterized by fear and threat (PIP culture?)
  - information is hoarded / distorted / withheld
  - when things go wrong the bosses look for a "throat to choke"
- **Bureaucratic** (rules oriented)
  - first goal is to protect departments
  - defend "turf"
  - do things by the book
- **Generative** (performance oriented)
  - focus on the mission
  - primary concern is business performance

- culture predicts information flow

## Characteristics of Good Information

1. provides answers to the questions the receiver has
2. when they need it
3. in a usable format

- good information flow is critical to the safe operation of a high-tempo and high consequence environment
- culture predicts performance outcomes

## Topologies of Organizational Culture

|Pathological (Power-Oriented)|Bureaucratic (Rule-Oriented)|Generative (Performance-Oriented)
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Low cooperation|Modest cooperation|High cooperation|
|Messengers “shot”|Messengers neglected|Messengers trained|
|Responsibilities shirked|Narrow responsibilities|Risks are shared|
|Bridging discouraged|Bridging tolerated|Bridging encouraged|
|Failure leads to scapegoating|Failure leads to justice|Failure leads to inquiry|
| Novelty crushed | Novelty leads to problems | Novelty implemented| 

## Implications for high performing organizations regarding culture

- culture enhances performance via the following mechanisms
  - more effective collaboration
  - higher level of trust
  - emphasis on the mission
  - set aside personal issues
  - encourage a level playing field (hierarchy plays less of a role)

### a note on bureaucracy

- not necessarily bad on its own
- ensures fairness by applying rules evenly (assuming fair rules and consistent application)
- "rules" are often designed by experts and represent the best form of accumulated knowledge in the org.
- **a rule-oriented culture** in the above context should therefore be considered one where rules become more imporant than the mission. 

## Unpacking the impact of Culture

- organizations with better imformation flow function more effecively
- good culture requires trust and cooperation
- good culture can indicate higher quality decision making with better information available
- more likely to be open and transparent
- problems rapidly discovered and addressed
- Culture predicts software delivery and organizational performance
- Good culture also predicts higher levels of job satisfaction

- who is on a team is less important than how the team members interact
- it all comes down to team dynamics

## Changing a company culture

- to change culture don't bother with how people think
- change how they behave
- Lean and agile methodologies _can_ have an effect on culture
- "fake it 'till you make it"
- you can "act your way to a better culture" by implementing both
  - lean management
  - continuous delivery
