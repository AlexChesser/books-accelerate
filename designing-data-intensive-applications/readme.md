## What to expect

Each week, I will discuss the contents of the assigned reading as listed above on the schedule. There won't be any live chat in these series. I've found that people who watch the playback don't care for the "banter" portions of the show.

A note about the schedule for this one, I'm a VERY wary of over-committing to doing three books in parallel. While I'll be adding chapters as I get through them, this one is intended to "pick up" as the other two wind down.

We're going to focus on the content and try and push on through. Hopefully, we all learn something.

In addition to written notes, they'll be read out and discussed via the "LGTM shipit" channel on youtube:

## Other series

- "[tech interview preparation course](https://github.com/AlexChesser/tech-interview-prep-course)" if you're looking to prepare for an interview in Tech that is an OK run through the things you have to know.
- and of course, the other books in this repo.
